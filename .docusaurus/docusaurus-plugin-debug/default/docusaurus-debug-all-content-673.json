Especially with the uprising in tech careers, individuals need to be aware of how their personalities could play a major role in choosing one they will succeed at and find fulfillment in.\r\n\r\n<!--truncate-->\r\n\r\n## Introduction\r\n\r\nRemember the good old days of elementary school when we'd be asked what we'd like to become when we grow up? Many of us come up with various career options that sounded, you know, cool to us. We come up with various careers like a lawyer, nurses, doctors, and engineers. \r\n\r\nWell, while many of us realize we couldn't become these things for one reason or the other, this is where career development starts, and it spans throughout a lifetime. Now, a host of factors influence this change in career choice, but none has played a major part in it as personality. \r\n\r\nThis is because your career is all about you, and you are all about your personality. We'll look into the reason why your personality matters so much to your career development, and how you can assess your personality for your job fit. But first, let's examine what a personality test is about.\r\n\r\n## What is a Personality Test?\r\n\r\nHistorically, **personality tests** emerged in the late 18th century and gained ground in the 19th century, but its name back then was *'phrenology'*. This traditional method involved the measurements of pumps on the human skull, which were then tagged with specific personality traits. Of course, this strange technique has been overrun today by the advent of modern science and technology. \r\n\r\nSubsequent propositions have been introduced by several psychologists in an attempt to discover the number of personality traits in existence. For instance, Gordon Allport proposed that there were more than 4,000 personality traits. Another psychologist, Raymond Cattell utilized a statistical method known as factor analysis to whittle down the list to just 16, while Hans Eysenck narrowed it to just 3. \r\n\r\nSo, what's this personality test? Well, we can derive the meaning from the keyword- *'personality'*. **Personality** refers to the combination of traits that form an individual's unique characteristics such as prototypical thinking, feelings, interests, and behaviors. Consequently, **personality tests** are tools used to assess human personality constructs (motivations, preferences, interests, emotional make-up, and style of interaction). \r\n\r\nFor this article, they are techniques designed to elicit information about the characteristic pattern of traits people exhibit across various situations and match it up with suitable career roles. These tests can take the form of interviews, in-basket reviews, and self-report inventories (questionnaires).\r\n\r\nAnother term we should be acquainted with is: **Personality Job** **Fit**\r\n\r\n> This refers to how well an individual's personality traits are suited to his or her work role. \r\n\r\n[Read more on personality-job fit here.](https://www.criteriacorp.com/resources/glossary/job-fit)\r\n\r\n## What is Career Development?**\r\n\r\nCareer development is a process of self-knowledge, exploration, and decision-making that shapes one's career. It requires successfully navigating your occupational options to choose and train for jobs that suit your personality, skills, abilities, and interests.\r\n\r\nCareer development is directly linked to an individual's career goals and objectives. It starts with self-actualization and self-assessment of one's interests and capabilities. The result of such self-analysis will then give the analyst an inkling of the roles and industries that match these skills and interests.\r\n\r\nCareer development is so important to a person's career choice for many reasons:\r\n\r\n- Career development is so important because it has everything to do with an individual's growth and satisfaction in their career (this is why it should be managed by the individual and not left to the employer). \r\n\r\n- Career development helps an individual grow both professionally and personally.\r\n\r\n- It gives an individual insight into areas they need to improve on in their career. For instance, a person could realize that they need to improve on their communication skills, and will take the necessary training for that purpose.\r\n\r\n## Why Your Personality is the Most Important Factor in Your Career Development\r\n\r\nA person's career development is influenced by [multiple factors](https://www.thebalancecareers.com/what-is-career-development-525496), but the most important influence is a person's personality. \r\n\r\nOur characteristic (personality type, interests, aptitudes, and work-related values) makes us who we are. These personal characteristics play a significant role in career development since they influence which occupation, we'll find satisfactory, as well as the type of work environment we're most likely to succeed in. For instance, an individual who's non-assertive may be unhappy in an executive role, while extroverted individuals may be dissatisfied with working in a role that involves minimal human interaction. This is why the first stage in the process of choosing a career is to do a self-assessment of oneself.\r\n\r\nThis is where a personality test comes in. It'll assist an individual in finding their personality using a combination of personality traits or dimensions and linking it with various career options so they can have a successful and fulfilling career. A person's personality shouldn't be measured by simply tapping into a specific trait, but rather, it should be measured by combining all the personality scales.\r\n\r\n## How to Take Personality Tests\r\n\r\nThere are many approaches to personality today but the most popular and widely used in career development is the [**Big Five theory of personality](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-assessment/personality-and-careers/)**.** The theory suggests five broad personality traits for testing: extroversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, emotional stability, and agreeableness. [For more on these traits, check this page](http://career.iresearchnet.com/career-assessment/personality-and-careers/).\r\n\r\nToday, a wide variety of personality tests are carried out based on these theories. The two major types of personality tests are *self-report inventories* and *projective tests*. \r\n\r\nThe ***self-report inventories*** involves a test-taker reading out questions about personality traits and rating how well the question applies to them. \r\n\r\n**Projective Tests** involves presenting the test-taker with the vague scene, object, or scenario and then asking them to give their interpretation of the test item. Other types of personality tests include the Myer Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI), the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI), and the Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire.\r\n\r\n## Pitfalls Of Personality Tests**\r\n\r\nWhile Personality tests is useful, it has many drawbacks to it, some of which includes: \r\n\r\n- People tend to engage questions deceptively especially for the self-report inventory tests.\r\n\r\n- People are not always good at describing their behaviors.\r\n\r\n- Tests can take a long time to get over, and several hours in some instances.\r\n\r\n- Results could be inconsistent, invalid, or unreliable.\r\n\r\n## Conclusion\r\n\r\nCareer development involves the assessment of one's skills, abilities, and personality and matching them to a suitable career. Many factors influence a person's career development but the most important factor is personality. This is because it's the first stage of career development, plus it determines one's satisfaction, performance, and success in the career. These personalities can be discovered by taking a personality test. \r\n\r\nAfter taking these personality tests, the next stage in career development is to assess one's career options and find the right fit. Then, you can go ahead and secure the necessary training, and acquire the skills needed to thrive in the career."

And being in a community that understands inclusivity is very essential. \n\nIn this article I gave a deep dive into building an inclusive community, following the 7 P's for Community Building. \n<!--truncate-->\n\n## Introduction\n\"A Tech Community is the Backbone of every Techie\". \n\nThis shows how important Tech Communities are to a Techie and having an inclusive community is very important. \n\nTo have an inclusive community the following must be followed duly.\n\nThe 7 P's for Community Building are the following: \n\n1. People\n2. Purpose\n3. Place\n4. Participation\n5. Policy\n6. Promotion\n7. Performance\n\n## People - Who are your members?\n\nFor you to be able to know who your community is for, then you need to deliberately answer the below questions: \n\n\n- Who are the people you are gathering?\n\n- Who aren't the people you are gathering?\n\n- What are your members' demographics (age, occupation, etc.)?\n\n- What level or types of technology are the comfortable with?\n\n- What are their personal or professional goals and motivations?\n\n\nRemember your members represent the community. So understanding keenly who your community is for, is very vital as a Community leader and as a member of a tech community, knowing the members of the community interest in the community you belong to, is essential for your growth in that community. \n\nThe importance of the members of a community influences the Purpose of the community and influences the Community's goals. \n\n## Purpose - Why does your community exist?\n\nIt is important for you to know this: Your Goals are not your Community Goals. You need to know what your community wants.\n\nNow you need to deliberately also, answer the below questions, to help identify your community Purpose: \n\n\n- What is your community mission and how does it align with your members?\n\n- What is the specific objective for your community?\n\n- What specific problems does your community solve for the members? \n\n- What opportunities does your community create for the members?\n\nIdentifying the reason for the existence of the community will help in actualizing the community goals, vision, and mission statements. \n\n## Place - Where do members gather?\n\n\n- Where does your community gather online and/or offline?\n\n- How does your place of gathering make your members feel safe?\n\n- How many members do you want to gather?\n\n- How often do you want members to gather?\n\n- What legal or compliance issues do you have to consider? (HIPAA, GDPR, etc). \n\nThe place of your community gathering in some way influences the effectiveness of your members and the fulfillment of your community purpose. Also, it is important to always consider legal or compliance issues. Unfortunately, this article does not cover that but Read more about this [Meeting Data Compliance with a Wave of New Privacy Regulations: GDPR, CCPA, PIPEDA, POPI, LGPD, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, and More](https://cloud.netapp.com/blog/data-compliance-regulations-hipaa-gdpr-and-pci-dss). \n\n\n## Participation - What do members do?\n\nThe impact in a community is somewhat measured by its members' Participation. \n\n- What are all the different ways a member can participate in your community?\n\n- What kind of participation will be the most meaningful for your members?\n\n- What do you want members to experience and understand when they first join the community?\n\n- What recurring experiences can your members participate in?\n\n- What barriers are preventing members from participating and how can you remove them?\n\n- What rewards do you want your members to experience after participating?\n\nMembers' participation is very essential in Tech Communities because that is how they improve in their skills or learn new ones. \n\nEngaging your members through, speaking engagement events, Hackathons, Team Projects, etc., is very important in Tech Communities. \n\nAnd as a member of a tech community, you are required to actively be involved in the community you belong to. \n\nAnswering the above questions will help you understand members' participation better. \n\n\n## Policy - What are the values, guidelines & rules?\n\nThe policies surrounding your communities are also very important. Answering the below questions will help you understand this better.\n\n- What are your community's values? \n\n- How will your policy make members feel safe and alleviate the fear of judgment?\n\n- What behaviors and actions do you want to encourage in your community?\n\n- How shouldn't members act in the community?\n\n- What process exists for enforcing the rules of the community?\n\n\n## Promotion - How is the community discovered?\n\nThe promotion of your community is so important for both the community leader and members of the community. \n\n- How do people discover your community?\n\n- How fast do you want your community to grow?\n\n- Where do your potential members spend time now?\n\n- How can you motivate your existing members to invite others?\n\n- What marketing tools and resources can you use to help more people discover your community?\n\nThe above questions will help you in handling the promotion of your community in the right way. \n\n\n## Performance - How is success measured?\n\n- What are the success metrics for content and experiences?\n\n- How will you track participation in your community over time?\n\n- How often will you survey your community and interview your members?\n\n- What are the valuable actions that achieve your community's objectives?\n\n- How often will you report on community metrics and who will you be reporting to?\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conclusion, the 7 P's of Community have helped me to understand community organization, participation, and leadership. \n\nI really believe this article will be helpful to Tech Community Leaders and in some way to the members of tech communities."

But if you are just a random person who stumbled upon this post, then I will be just fair to explain what is a Tech Community. \n\nIn this article, I will be taking a deeper look into what tech communities are and how you can benefit from being in one. \n<!--truncate-->\n\n## Introduction\nA Tech Community simply put is a gathering or a group of individuals related by a skillset or a common purpose. Every tech community exists for a purpose and every member of a community is there because they agree with the purpose of the community. \n\nTech Communities exist to provide all forms of support, ranging from technical support to information support, to moral support, and in some cases material support. \n\nTech Communities are the backbone of techies. And can somewhat be termed the \"Techies Home\". \n\n## Why should I be in a Tech Community?\nYou may just be a Graphics Designer, a Frontend Developer, a Mobile Developer an Animator, etc., and may ask this question: ***\" Why should I belong to a Community?\"***\n\n> Every tech community is always centered around three basic things: Connect, Learn and Grow. \n\nAnd this is the reason why every aspiring techie should belong to and be active in a tech community. \n\nSo in every tech community, you get the opportunity to connect with people. Firstly, you meet those who are into what you do, and also others who are into other amazing stuff in tech.  Connecting with people is very important in this tech space. \n\nA lot of job opportunities can be gotten by connecting with people. \n\nSecondly, you learn in every tech community. You do this by attending meetups (tech events), hangouts, conferences, hackathons, etc. All these events in one way or another improve what you do. Learning always takes place in every tech community. Also know that soft skills are also acquired in tech communities, such as Proper Communication, Leadership, Organization, Presentation, Public Addressing, etc\n\nThirdly, you grow, ensure you don't remain stagnant. And in tech, you only grow when you build with what you have learned. So ensure you do not get stuck in following tutorials, but in building stuff after following a tutorial. And Tech Communities help you achieve this, through hackathons, build sessions, etc. \n\nAnother way you grow in a tech community is by giving back to the community. You give back to the community by organizing various training sessions and meetups to teach what you know. This is very important as a member of a community. \n\nThe importance of being in a Tech Community cannot be overemphasized, and you should be part of one!\n\n## Conclusion\nIn Conclusion, this is a list of a few Tech Communities, I recommend: \n1.

Data workflow involves the steps in which data flows through an organization.\n\nThere are four general steps involved in this process:\n\n- data collection and storage,\n\n- data preparation,\n\n- exploration and visualization and finally,\n\n- experimentation and prediction\n\n**Data collection and storage**: In this step, data professionals collect data from various sources such as surveys, browser history, social media etc. Due to the massive amount of data generated daily in various formats and from various sources, this task becomes a daunting one. After this collection, the data is stored in its raw format.\n\n**Data preparation**: In this step, data is cleaned to enable the discovery of instances of missing or duplicated values. This step also involves the conversion of data into a more organized format. This leads to the next step\n\n**Data exploration and visualization**: In this step, statistical techniques are used to identify and describe the structure of the data, the relationship between different data values and other crucial concepts which would enable the creation of visual aids (such as dashboards and diagrams) for tracking and comparing changes in datasets.\n\nThis step enables you to gain a good grasp of your data before you move on to the final step\n\n> A dataset is a collection of related data.\n\n**Experimentation and prediction**: In this step, it is assumed you have a good grasp of your data and are thus ready to perform certain tasks such as running experiments or building predictive models.\n\n## Data Engineers\n\nHaving understood the flow of data in an organization the answer to the question of the role of a data engineer in an organization becomes clearer.\n\nData engineers are responsible for the first step of the data workflow which involves the collection and storage of data.\n\nThey are the foundation of the data workflow process as they lay the groundwork for other professionals such as data analysts, data scientists and machine learning engineers who would prepare, explore and experiment with the data. Data engineers ensure that correct data is delivered efficiently, in the right format and to the right people.\n\nData engineers ingest data from various sources and optimize the databases for analysis as well as manage data corruption. They develop, construct, test and maintain architectures such as databases and large-scale processing systems to process and handle the massive amount of data gotten from different sources.\n\nIn simple terms, they collect data from many sources and manage it for other data professionals to access and use.\n\n## Conclusion\nIn conlusion, kindly take note of the following points:\n- Data engineers are responsible for the first step in the data workflow, collecting and storing data.\n\n- They lay the groundwork for data analysts, data scientists and machine learning engineers ensuring that data is not scattered, corrupted or difficult to access."

          "content": "Google introduced Carbon language as the next generation programming language **proxy to C++ programming language**. In this article we will learn about various aspects of Carbon language and Carbon language basic syntax along with cod examples that you can use to get started with Carbon Programming language. \n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\nC++ is a programming language that has been used since 1983, and it's an important tool in most codebases and overtime, it has built up a lot of technical debt. ***When it comes to creating high-performance low-level systems, it is by far the most widely used language***. \n\nOriginally demonstrated by Chandler Carruth in[CppNorth](https://cppnorth.ca/) Conference, Carbon language looks like a great alternative to C++ \n\nHowever there are various development breakthroughs that Carbon has to make if it's going to replace C++.\n\n**Let's Get Started**\n\n## Pre-Requisites\n\nTo comprehend the above programming language Article, a wide scope knowledge of C++ language is needed, however, if you are new to programming, this article will give you a dive guide about what carbon language is, and how to start coding and building up and it.**\n\n## What is Carbon Language and Why?\n\nNote: Carbon language is not inherited from C or C++. It's built from scratch with modern language fundamentals such as Generics, Modular code, Consistent, Simple syntax. \n\n**Some of the key aspects of Carbon languages includes:**\n\n1. Building on top of an existing ecosystem.\n2. Bi-directional interoperability\n3. Optimize learning curve\n4. Modern tooling systems like package manager etc.\n\n## Challenges with C++ Programming Language\n\nC++ is already a great language to work with. It gives high performance and is widely used in many production systems. It can also run with multiple platforms, hardware architecture and many operating systems. \n\nHowever some of the problems with C++ are:\n\n1. Accumulated technical debt (e.g. Integer promotion rules) across various functionalities. \n2. Backward compatibility with C makes it even more hard to fix tech debt and make code changes hard to implement.\n3. Evolution process to add new functionalities to C++ is very difficult as it needs to adhere to ISO process overhead, preventing from experimentation etc.**\n\nSo C++ is falling short of some of it's goals like performance, software and language evolution, ability to easily read and write the code, fast and scalable development and so on.\n\nSince solving these problems with C++ is really hard, after a deep research and evaluation, across multiple languages by Google engineers **Carbon programming language** is introduced. So it is like a successor to C++ similar to: \n\n- **C - C++**\n- **JavaScript -TypeScript**\n- **Objective-C - Swift**\n- **Java - Kotlin**\n- **C++ - Carbon Language**\n\n\n\n## Key Features of Carbon Language\n\n1. Fast performance: Matching C++ using LLVM (low level virtual machine), having low level access to bits and addresses, will drive faster performance. \n\n2. Bi-directional Interoperability: indicates that you can call C++ language code from Carbon language and Carbon language code from C++.\n\n3. Migration: Carbon provides support to migrate code from C++.\n\n4. Modern and evolving: Carbon provides features that makes it fast and scalable. Providing builds that can work with existing C++ builds.\n\n5. Built with Open Source: Carbon is an Open Source project with clear goals and priorities, with great compilers, compiler libraries, documentation, package manager etc.\n\n## How to setup and install Carbon language:\n\nGetting started with Carbon language involves installation of:\n\n1. Homebrew: This is a package installation tool. If you don't have homebrew installed you can follow these [instructions](https://brew.sh/). \n\nIn MacOs you can install homebrew using `/bin/bash -c \"$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)\"`\n\n2. Bazel: Bazel is an open-source build and test tool which can support multiple languages, platforms.\n\nTo install Bazel on MacOS: \n`$ brew install bazelisk` for more information to install Bazel on other OS, please follow this link: (Bazel Installation Guide)[https://bazel.build/install]\n\nThis should automatically install and setup Bazel that is ready to use. If you have any errors related to permissions, the error message from Bazel will have useful command to run. Try to run that command using sudo.\n\n3. LLVM: LLVM is a low level virtual machine that Carbon language uses to run. You may not need to have full knowledge of LLVM to follow this tutorial.\n\n**LLVM is the core virtual machine on which carbon language is run on.**\n\nTo Install LLVM:\n**To install LLVM on MacOS**\n`$ brew install llvm`\n`$ export PATH=\"$(brew --prefix llvm)/bin:${PATH}\"`\n\nOne thing to note is MacOS has a default LLVM . So using ***brew install LLVM*** may give a message like  LLVM is keg-only, which means it was not symlinked.\n\nTo find out more, check out (https://llvm.org/)[LLVM]. \n\n4. Carbon Explorer: Carbon explorer is like an implementation tool to Carbon language. To run all the programs of Carbon lang, we will use carbon explorer.\n\n### Setting up Carbon language Code\nTo setup Carbon language code,run the commands below on a MacOS Terminal: \n1. `$ git clone https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang`\n2. `$ cd carbon-lang`\n\n\n### Writing a Hello world Program in Carbon Programming language\n\nNow that we have setup Carbon language, let's run our first program. To do that we will use Carbon explorer to run. To run your first code in Carbon, make sure you are in the **carbon-lang**\ndirectory that you cloned from git and then run below command.\n\n`$ bazel run //explorer -- ./explorer/testdata/print/format_only.carbon`\n\n***What this command is doing, is to invoke Bazel build tool to trigger explorer code that in turns runs the actual code present in the ./explorer/testdata/print/format_only.carbon file***\n\n**Once you run this you should see  Hello world in Carbon output like this**\n![Output](./img1.png)\n\nAs you can see “Hello World!” is printed and return type of main is int32 resulting to 0. \n\nThe code that is behind this hello world program is\nFile path:./explorer/testdata/print/format_only.carbon\n\n![Output](./img2.png)\n\nFor windows, Carbon language is not yet natively supported. However you can install ***wsl*** which is like installing Linux on top of windows.   \n\nYou can do that using `wsl --install` and then perform above steps.\n\nThe file extension for Carbon language code is carbon. So if you write new carbon language file you need to have a file which ends with extension of .carbon. \nExample: demo.carbon .\n\nNow that we have carbon language setup, let’s look at some of the basic syntax of Carbon language.\n\n### Carbon Language Basic Syntax with examples:\nCarbon language is still in experimental phases. While most of the design choices are made already, some of the syntax and usage might change as things evolve. So keep that in mind while working with Carbon-lang. \n\nOne great thing about Carbon is that the syntax should be C/C++ developer friendly and easy to understand.\n\nFor the best use of this tutorial, to follow along with each of these examples, you can run the below examples using Carbon language explorer that you installed in the previous step. \n\nIf you are running in your own machine, you can create new files each time you run a program or modify **./explorer/testdata/print/format_only.carbon** file to check the examples.\n\nEach time you modify the code,run \n`bazel run //explorer -- ./explorer/testdata/print/format_only.carbon`\n\n**Note: format_only.carbon is just a sample file. Change it to whichever filename you created.**\n\nAlternatively, you can also use Carbon online explorer IDE to run through the below examples.\n\nJust copy paste below examples in the online IDE and you can see live results.\n\nLink for online carbon explorer IDE is at (https://carbon.godbolt.org/)[Carbon Godbolt] or (https://carbon.compiler-explorer.com/)[Carbon online explorer].\n\nLet’s get started on how to use carbon language:\n\n**Declarations in carbon lang:**\n1. Methods/Functions are declared using ***fn*** keyword.\n2. Variables are declared using ***var*** keyword.\n3. Variable names should end with: followed by space eg: ***var x***.\n4. Constants can be declared using ***let*** keyword.\n5. Packages are declared using ***package*** keyword.\n6. Comments in Carbon language can be declared using two slashes ***//***\n7. ***Auto*** can be used to automatically infer the variable type. It can be used in combination of ***let or var*** or as function return types.\n\n***Example/ Demo code:***\n` package ExplorerTest api; //fn is function delcaration // return type is i32 i.e.e init. fn Main() -> i32 {//I am a comment. var s: auto = \"Hello world!\"; // Auto Variable let x: i32 = 20; //Constant var y: i32 = 3; // Integer variable Print(s); // Print return 0; //Return value } `\n\n## Functions/Methods in Carbon\nFunctions can be declared using ***fn** keyword. . The syntax is ***fn MethodName (var param: type ... ) -> return type***. \n\nFor void or empty return types, you can ignore the part after ***->***\n\n**********Code Sample:**:**:**:**:** \n` package ExplorerTest api;//Integer return type fn Sum(var a: i32 var b: i32) -> i32 {return a + b;} //Empty or void return type. fn PrintCount(var count: i32) {Print(\"The count is {0}\", count);}fn Main() -> i32 {Print(\"Sum is {0}\", Sum(4, 6));PrintCount(10);return 0;}`\n\n### Numeric Variables in carbon lang:\n\nVariables in carbon language can be\n1. bool for boolean true or false\n2. i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, i256 for integer types.\n3. u8, u16, u32, u128, u256 for unsigned integer types.\n4. f16, f32, f64, and f128 for float types.\n5. _ can be used for digit separators. Eg: 1_000_000 is still an integer if declared without quotes.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n`package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -> i32 {var a: i32 = 1;var b: i32 = 2;Print(a + b);return 0;}`\n\n### Strings in carbon language:\nStrings can be declared using:\n1. String for byte sequence\n2. StringView as a read only reference for utf-8 byte sequence.\n\nStrings literals can be declared in two ways:\n1.\tSingle Line: Use double quotation mark(\") for single line.\n2.\tMulti line string: For multi line string declaration use (\"\"\")\n\n**Code Sample:**\n`package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -> i32 {var singleLine: String = \"Hello world!\";var multiLine: String = \"\"\"hello line 1 TipSeason demo line 2 TipSeason demo line 3 \"\"\"; //End of multi block return 0;} `\n\n### Tuples in Carbon Language:\nTuples represent values with multiple coordinates. They can be declared using parenthesis ().\n\n**Code Sample:**\n`package ExplorerTest api; fn Main() -> i32 {var x: auto = (0, 1);Print(\"{0}\", x[1]); return x[0];}`\n\nHere (x,y,z) is a tuple with multiple coordinates. They can be accessed using the index.\n\n### Pointers in Carbon language:\nThere are no null pointers in Carbon.\n\nTo represent a pointer that may not refer to a valid object, use the type Optional(T*) where T is the type, * represents value, & represents address.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n` package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -> i32 {var x: i32 = 5;// changes x to 10 x = 10;Print(\"---\"); Print(\"x = {0}\", x);var y: i32* = &x;// changes x to 7 * y = 7;Print(\"---\");Print(\"x = {0}\", x);Print(\"y = {0}\", *y);var z: i32* = &*y;// changes x to 0*z = 0;Print(\"---\");Print(\"x = {0}\", x);Print(\"y = {0}\", *y);Print(\"z = {0}\", *z);var w: i32 = *y;return w;}`\n\n### Arrays in Carbon\nArrays are declared using array type and the size. Syntax is [type; size] Eg: var x array: [i32; 4] = (1,2,3,4);\n\n**Code Sample:**\n`package ExplorerTest api; fn Main() -> i32 {var xarray: [i32; 4] = (0, 1, 5, 6); // Integer array var index: i32 = 1; xarray[index] = 0;Print(\"{0}\", xarray[0]);Print(\"{1}\", xarray[0]);return xarray[0] + xarray[1];}`\n\n### Conditional control flow with carbon\n\nCombination of ***if*** , ***else*** can be used to control the conditional flow in Carbon.\n\n**if-else Syntax:**\n\nif(condition) {\n //doSomething\n} else {\n //doSomething\n} \n\n**if-else-if Syntax**\n\nif(condition) {\n //doSomething\n} else if (condition) {\n //doSomething\n} else {\n  //doSomething\n}\n\n\n**Code Sample:**\n\n`package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -> i32 {var x: i32 = 5;if(x == 5) {Print(\"{0} to word is FIVE\", x);} else {Print(\"{0} is not known \", x);}return 0;}`\n\n### Loops in Carbon Language\nStandards looping statements are supported.\n\n**While loop**\nWhile loop can be declared using while(condition){ } syntax.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n`package ExplorerTest api; fn Main() -> i32 {var x: auto = 5; while (not (x == 0)) {x = x - 1; Print(\"{0}  \", x);}return x;}` \n\n\n\n### For Loop\n\nFor loop can be declared using ***for (loop conditions) { }***. \n\n**Code Sample:**\n`package ExplorerTest api; fn Main() -> i32 {var names: [String; 4] = (\"a\", \"b\"); for (var name: String in names) {Console.Print(name);}return x;}`\n### Match multiple conditions similar to Switch.\n\nCarbon has match keyword which is similar to switch in C/C++. Syntax for match is: \n\n`match(condition) {case (condition) => {//doSomething;} default =>{//doSomething;}}`\n\n**Code Sample:**\n\n`package ExplorerTest api; fn Matcher(var num: i32) -> i32 {var number: auto = 10;match (number) {case 5 => {Print(\"Got 5\");return number;}case 10 => {Print(\"Got 10\");return number;}default => {Print(\"Default\");return number;}}} fn Main() -> i32 {Matcher(5);Matcher(10); Matcher(2); return 0;}`\n\n### Classes in Carbon Language:\nClass in carbon language can be declared using class keyword. Class can have members and methods. \n\nHere is an example class implementation:\n\n` package ExplorerTest api; class Sum {var a: i32; fn Add[me: Self](var num: i32) -> i32 {var total: i32 = me.a + num; return total;}}fn Main() -> i32 {var p1: Sum = {.a = 5};var total: i32 = p1.Add(5);Print(\"Total sum {0}\" , total);return 0;}`\n\n**Structs in Google Carbon Language:**\n\nStructural types help you identify members using the name instead of their index/position. \n\nThey are declared within curly braces \n\nvar name: auto = {.name1 = value1, .name2 = value2, ... } and can be accessed using name.name1 etc.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n` package ExplorerTest api;fn Main() -> i32 {var point: auto = {.x_axis = 0, .y_axis = 1};point = {.x_axis = 5, .y_axis = -5};var result: i32 = point.x_axis * point.x_axis + point.y_axis * point.y_axis;Print(\"Result : {0}\", result);return 0;}`\n### Generics in Carbon Programming Language\n\nGenerics can be seen in many modern languages. They define a way to induce compile time type checks and helps define cleaner type variables. They can be declared using T parameter types are shown below.\n\n**Code Sample:**\n` package ExplorerTest api;fn GenericExample[T:! Type](x: T) -> T {return x;} fn Main() -> i32 {Print(\"Integer generic type {0}\", GenericExample(0)); Print(GenericExample(\"This is a string generic\"));return 0;}`\n\n### Memory safety in Carbon language:\nCarbon language has a heavy focus on memory management especially when it comes to memory safety. At a very high level carbon language plans to achieve memory safety using:\n\n1. Spatial Memory safety\n2. Temporal memory safety \n\nHere is a detailed tutorial on how memory safety is achieved in carbon along with goals and basics.Check(https://tipseason.com/carbon-language-memory-safety)[Carbon language memory safety for secure memory management] \n\nFinally, to end this article, I will be providing supporting links to find out more about (https://github.com/carbon-language/carbon-lang)[Carbon programming language]."

          "content": "This article while having not undergone a scientific research is\ntargeted at providing the relevance of tech in promoting mental health amongst individuals of different age, sex and even race.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\nNOTE: While this may seem to prove that there is confirmation of this\narticle being biased towards a class of the population, it would prove\nto be a fun read and may even be a major break-through for researchers\nin both the tech and mental health field to be able to carry out further\nresearch.\n\nLet's ride!!!!!\n\n## Introduction\nSo many people may have watched the popular American science fiction\naction film ***Ready Player One,*** which was released March 2018, based\non Ernest Cline's novel of the same name.\n\nDirected by Steven Spielberg from a screenplay by Zak Penn and Cline, it\nstars Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke, Ben Mendelsohn, Lena Waithe, T.J.\nMiller, Simon Pegg and Mark Rylance.\n\nThe film is set in 2045, where much of humanity uses the OASIS,\na virtual reality simulation, to escape the real world. The orphaned\nWade Watts finds clues to a contest that promises the ownership of the\nOASIS to the winner, and he and his allies try to complete it before an\nevil corporation can do so.\n\nNow you're probably wondering where I'm going with all this information\nand how relevant is it. It gets more interesting.\n\nSo let's start by learning all about Virtual Reality and Mental Health.\nHowever, to aid easy understanding, I'd like to focus more on\npsychiatric individuals (this doesn't out rightly mean patients in a\npsychiatric facility but individuals whom may need the expertise of\nexperts who work in psychiatry).\n\n## What is Virtual Reality???\n\nThe term \"virtual reality\" is credited to Jaron Lanier, who was the\nfounder of VPL Research in 1984, a company that develops and sells\nvirtual reality products. The term \"virtual reality,\" was first used in\nthe mid-1980s when Jaron Lanier, founder of VPL Research, began to\ndevelop the gear, including goggles and gloves, needed to experience\nwhat he called \"virtual reality.\"\n\n**Virtual Reality (VR)** is an advanced, human-computer interface that\nsimulates a realistic environment. The participants can move around in\nthe virtual world. They can see it from different angles, reach into it,\ngrab it and reshape it. There is no little screen of symbols for neither\nmanipulation nor commands to be entered to get the computer to do\nsomething. \n\n**Cyberspace** is thought of as the ultimate virtual reality\nenvironment. It is an alternative computer universe where data exists\nlike cities of light. Information workers use a special virtual reality\nsystem to enter cyberspace and to travel its data highways. This gives\nthem the experience of being physically free to go anywhere.\n\nVirtual Reality involves electronic and mechanical engineering,\ncybernetics, database design, real-time and distributed systems,\nsimulation, computer graphics, human engineering, stereoscope, human\nanatomy and, even, artificial life. The many challenges for creating\nvirtual reality systems include: software, hardware, human factors and\nVR over high-speed networks.\n\n## What is Mental Health??\n\nMental health refers to cognitive, behavioral, and emotional well-being.\nIt is all about how people think, feel, and behave. \"Mental health is a\nstate of mental well-being that enables people to cope with the stresses\nof life, realize their abilities, learn well and work well, and\ncontribute to their community.\"\n\nPeople sometimes use the term \"mental health\" to mean the absence of a\nmental disorder.\n\nHaving discussed these two concepts as much as I can to facilitate basic\nunderstanding, I would like to focus more on certain aspects such as how\na *full immersive virtual reality* may help to prompt individuals with\n*social phobia* to overcome their ineptness in a more subtle, controlled\nand relaxing manner.\n\nA Fully Immersive virtual reality ensures a realistic virtual\nexperience. It would feel as if you are physically present in the\nvirtual world and the events occurring there are happening to you.\n\nSpecial equipment like VR glasses, gloves, body detectors equipped with\nsense detectors is required to provide a realistic virtual experience.\nThe data from these sensors is used by the computer and the virtual\nworld responds to that in real-time to provide users with a realistic\nvirtual experience.\n\nAn example of this would be a Virtual Gaming Zone, where using special\ngear you and other players can interact with the virtual environment,\nall at the same time, and play with or against each other.\n\nAt the mention of virtual reality, the VR glasses in an arcade is the\nmost likely to pop into your mind because that's the place where most\npeople have likely experienced the virtual world but we can see from the\nAmerican science fiction action film ***Ready Player One*** by Steven\nSpielberg and Cline that more can be done in the virtual world.\n\nA fully immersive virtual reality like the one adapted in the movie\nallows its users to customize not only their names but also allows them\nto decide how they appear in the virtual world. More so, it allows you\nto meet, interact and reach out to other people all the while not\naltering normal functioning but rather allowing its users to choose\ntheir environment and explore it like they normally would in reality.\n\nIt's normal to feel nervous in some social situations. For example,\ngoing on a date or giving a presentation may cause that feeling of\nbutterflies in your stomach. But in social anxiety disorder, also called\n*social phobia*, everyday interactions cause significant anxiety,\nself-consciousness and embarrassment because you fear being scrutinized\nor judged negatively by others.\n\nIn social anxiety disorder, fear and anxiety lead to avoidance that can\ndisrupt your life. Severe stress can affect your relationships, daily\nroutines, work, school or other activities.\n\nSocial anxiety disorder can be a chronic mental health condition, but\nlearning coping skills in psychotherapy and taking medications can help\nyou gain confidence and improve your ability to interact with others.\n\nAnyone could be anxious socially which is perfectly fine but it also\nmeans people with social phobia have little to no interaction or\nrelationships. Helping someone with a social phobia can most often prove\nto be difficult thing to do as cases have their own level of extremity.\n\nThen the question that would most likely be asked is how do we get\nindividuals with social anxiety disorder to come out of their own shell\nand begin to open themselves up to others around them without being\nforced and in an environment where they can easily engage a \"flight\nresponse\" when they feel overwhelmed?\n\nThis is a question that I believe the introduction of virtual reality\nmay seek to proffer solution to, in that;\n\n1.  They have the liberty to choose a unique name and identity for\n    themselves and still be able to maintain their animosity in the\n    virtual environment. For example, people who feel uncomfortable with\n    their self-image can modify their physique, voice, skin color to\n    what they want other people to perceive them as.\n\n2.  They can select the scenery and elements that they want contained in\n    the virtual environment, i.e., they are able to select where they want to\n    visit. For example, someone who is scared of animals would be able\n    to avoid places in the virtual environment that supports animals.\n\n3.  They can choose the time that's most convenient for them to enter the virtual           environment, decide when to leave and whether to interact with others or just explore.\n\n4.  The virtual environment also allows them to be able to control the\n    presence of others in their space. They can choose to invite and\n    reach out to any character of their choice while exerting control.\n\n5.  The virtual environment also can allow people with social phobia to\n    seek the professional help they need i.e. they can schedule their\n    therapy sessions to take place in the virtual space and still be\n    able to maintain animosity.\n\n## Limitations of Virtual Reality\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) is starting to be used in psychological therapy\naround the world. However, a thorough understanding of the reason why VR\nis effective and what effect it has on the human psyche is still\nmissing.\n\nAlso, the cost of acquiring a virtual reality gear is relatively high.\nCertain parts of the world with unstable network connection and inconsistent\npower supply would heavily affect the methods described in the article.\n\nIn conclusion you would agree with me that this has proved to be somewhat\ngood read and that tech is very useful in enhancing and supporting all\nexisting fields.\n\nThis article is open to constructive criticism and further suggestions\nand improvements would be greatly appreciated. While there are limited\nmaterials that supports my claim, the idea is that as times continue to\nchange, the tech space would be able to develop methods to help mental\nhealth practitioners reach their audience, help people find it less\ndifficult to open up about their mental health issues and seek the\nprofessional help they need while being able to control when, how they\nget help and whom they seek help from.\n\n## Supporting Links to Learn and find out more\n\n<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ready_Player_One_(film)>\n\n<https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/social-anxiety-disorder/symptoms-causes/syc-20353561>\n\n[In case you have not seen the movie and you are interested in watching\nit](https://www.sabishare.com/file/ElTTlcTVQ93-ready-player-one-2018-netnaija-com-mp4)\n\n## References\nJ.

          "content": "This article is for someone who just started writing Go, and have no idea about //go:embed feature which came with the released version: 1.16.\n\nA project I was working on recently led to the discoveries.\n\n<!--truncate-->\n\n## So what is //go:embed?\n\nThe embed package allows us to embed static/template or directories into our Go program\n\n## When should you use //go:embed in your project?\n//go:embed can be used in situations where the file or assets won't change or be modified after build, dont shoot yourself in the leg by embedding files that are subjected to modifications e.g ```config.json``` and all type of files similar to this\n\nexamples of assets that you can use ```//go:embed``` for are ```templates/css``` files and anything similar to this\n\n## How to use it in CLI programs?\n\nIf you are writing your CLI tool using frameworks like cobra, urfave-cli, you will know that your commands files e.g root.go and the likes are alway in a \"cmd\" folder\n\n```mdx\nhello_cobra\n├─ cmd\n│  ├─ config.go\n│  ├─ root.go\n│  └─ run.go\n├─ go.mod\n├─ go.sum\n├─ main.go\n└─ templates\n   ├─ config.html\n   ├─ creds.html\n   └─ index.html\n```\n\nand the rule that comes with //go:embed is that you can only embed via your root folder, so lets say you have your template folder inside your main project folder, just the way my project folder is above\n\nThen you can easily embed using main.go file in your root folder or any other go file in root folder\n\nbut in situation where your template files is needed or called inside your \"cmd\" folder, i need to embed my template from my cmd>>config.go file.\n\nIt becomes tricky from there? you get it right? meaning  //go:embed won't work, it will start spitting errors like ```pattern ****/: no matching files found```\n\nbecause you can only use embed from the root files and now you need to call it from a file inside the \"cmd\" which is not available on the root.\n\ni was stucked man, spent two to three days thinking and searching the internet for solution, pushing my project depends on getting the static/template assets files embed.\n\nNow you probably thinking why dont i move my template folder into the \"cmd\" folder? yes i did that too, but using   ```//go:embed templates/*.html``` wasnt working still\n\nbut at last i stumbled upon https://github.com/plentico/plenti repo, the guy did what i have been trying to do, infact he has lot of static files\n\nbut what he did is different from what every article i have come acrossed did and shared, he used this syntax ```//go:embed all:yourfolders/*``` while other content out there states to use this ```//go:embed yourfolders/*```\n\ndon't get me wrong both ar correct, but ```//go:embed all:yourfolders/*```  works well for embedding from files that are not in root folder, in situations where your folder is like this\n\n```mdx\nhello_cobra\n├─ cmd\n│  ├─ config.go\n│  ├─ root.go\n│  └─ run.go\n└─ templates\n   ├─ config.html\n   ├─ creds.html\n   └─ index.html\n├─ go.mod\n├─ go.sum\n├─ main.go\n```\n\nand how is i embedthe templates in my config.go\n\n```go title=\"hello_cobra/cmd/config.go\"\npackage cmd\n\nimport (\n\t\"embed\"\n\t\"fmt\"\n\t\"net/http\"\n\t\"text/template\"\n\n\t\"github.com/spf13/cobra\"\n)\n\n//go:embed all:templates/*.html   //this means, embed all files ending with \".html\"  in the templates folder even when ignored\nvar TempFs embed.FS //assign the variable TempFs to embed.FS, FS means (File System)\n\nvar tmpl *template.Template //tmpl is a type pointer to template.Template,\n\n\nfunc init() {\n\trootCmd.AddCommand(configCmd)\n\ttmpl = template.Must(template.ParseFS(TempFs, \"templates/*.html\"))\n}\n\nfunc myTempl(w http.ResponseWriter, _ *http.Request) {\n\n///you can do all your codes here,\n\terr = tmpl.ExecuteTemplate(w, \"creds.html\", nil) //Executing the template\n\tif err != nil {\n\t\tlog.Fatal(\"Error loading index template: \", err) //log an error, if the template cant be started\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAnd that's all, If you want to learn more about //go:embed read over here <a href=\"https://pkg.go.dev/embed\">here</a>."

It is built on the same technology as Azure AD but for a different purpose.\n\nAzure AD B2C provides a highly customizable **User Experience** to suit and blend with your brand seamlessly. Allowing you to customize every page when a user signs up, signs in, and modifies their profile information, providing a native look and feel that follows your web, mobile, and other applications. \n\nCheck out the docs for more information [Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/).\n\n# Using Azure AD B2C in Power Pages\nPower Pages supports authentication processes and provides various authentication providers to handle authentication. \n\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-12 at 19.41.53.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657651546255/11Q3FMgDf.png)\n\nWith this, you can provide and set up several authentication providers on your website. \n\nNow, let us see how to set up Azure AD B2C to handle our authentication needs for our websites while building with **Microsoft Power Pages**.\n\n**Requirements**\n\n1. To duly follow this tutorial you need to have an Azure account and an active subscription plan\n\n2. Before you can use the Azure AD B2C for authentication, they must be registered in a tenant that you manage.\n\n3. Also, you need to have Microsoft.AzureActiveDirectory as a resource provider for the Azure subscription you're using. \n\nFollow this tutorial, to **[Create an Azure Active Directory B2C tenant](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-tenant)**\n\nIf you followed the tutorial carefully, you should have successfully created your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant. \n\n**Next Step:**\nThe next step for setting up Azure AD B2C authentication for Power Pages is to **Register a web application in Azure Active Directory B2C**. \n\nKindly follow this tutorial: **[Register a web application in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-register-applications?tabs=app-reg-ga)**\n\nIf you successfully followed the docs properly, you should have your web application registered in Azure Active Directory B2C.\n\nFollowing the screenshot below, you should have your registered web application:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-07-15 at 00.00.39.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657839670006/FPVddK1M2.png)\n\nThe next thing to do is to **set up user flows and custom policies**. \nLet us follow this tutorial/documentation: [Create User flows and custom policies in Azure Active Directory B2C](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory-b2c/tutorial-create-user-flows?pivots=b2c-user-flow)\n\nAfter following the previous tutorial in the link above, **(kindly get back to it, before you proceed with this step)**, let us head back to Identity Configuration Page in Power Pages, to complete our Configuration settings.\n\n![Main.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1657842228366/z3APN-v_L.png)\n\n**A few things to note, while configuring your Identity Configuration page in Power Pages: \n**\n1.

And in this article we will be learning more about data and data connectors, and how to make use of them in a Power Apps Project. \n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## What are Data Connectors?\nIn very clear terms, \"Data Connectors\" connects or communicates with the data source in every power app. Data is stored in a data source, and you bring that data into your app by creating a connection.\n\nIn Microsoft Power Apps a connector may provide tables of data or actions. Some connectors provide only tables, some provide only actions, and some provide both. Also, your connector may be either a **standard or custom connector**.\n\n\n\n### Popular Connectors used in Microsoft Power Apps\n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 21.41.16.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648068186548/PpzISxxP8.png)\n\n\n### Standard and Custom Connectors\nStandard Connectors are connectors provided by Power Apps for many commonly used data sources. If Power Apps has a standard connector for the type of data source that you want to use, you should use that connector, those are what are referred to as Standard Custom Connectors.\n\nThe image above showing popular connectors are all Standard Connectors. \n\nBut in a situation where you want to connect to other types of data sources, such as the one you built, then they are referred to as Custom Connectors \n\nCheck out this article for more on  Custom Connectors - [Register and use custom connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/register-custom-api)\n\n\n## Connecting to Microsoft Dataverse\n\nMicrosoft Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that are used by business applications. \nData within Dataverse is stored within a set of tables. A table is a set of rows (formerly referred to as records) and columns (formerly referred to as fields/attributes). Each column in the table is designed to store a certain type of data, for example, name, age, salary, and so on.\n\nNow with the understanding of the Dataverse let us get into this codelab!\n\n## Building a simple record-keeping app with Google Sheets (a Standard Connector)\n1. [Sign in to Power Apps](https://powerapps.microsoft.com/en-gb/) If you don't already have a Power Apps account, click the Start Free button. \n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 22.08.09.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648069794826/R9dcIU9gf.png)\n\n2. After successful sign in to Power Apps this is what you should have now! \n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 22.06.26.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648070361469/Nw9BDRTVW.png) \nClick on the Dataverse card. \n\n3. You should have this screen now, showing previous connections. Then you click on New Connection\n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 22.44.33.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648071904563/nF1IbpMyF.png)\n\n4. If you followed the previous step properly, you should have this now, then click on Google Sheets and authenticate with your Google account. \n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 22.49.21.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648072193448/xuF2XoCxq.png)\nNow you choose a dataset, from a set of previous google sheet documents or perhaps you search for the one you have in mind just as I have done here. \n\n5. The next option is to choose a table or create a new one. \n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 22.50.57.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648072298364/RbnL3xXvZ.png)\n\n6. And finally you should have a very simple app for you with the data from the table you chose or created. Just as I have here too. \n\n![Screenshot 2022-03-23 at 22.52.24.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1648072410585/B6m12frDk.png)\n\nThat is the end of this codelab and hope you were able to follow it properly. \n\nI will also be ending this article here now, leaving you with resources for further study. \n\n## Resources\n1. [Overviewof connectors for canvas apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/connections-list)\n2. [Use custom connectors in a Power Apps canvas app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/use-custom-connectors-in-powerapps-canvas-app/)\n3. [Microsoft Dataverse Documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/data-platform/)\n4. [Use custom connectors with the timeline control](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/custom-connectors-timeline-control)\n\nSo concluding now, in this article we understood what are Data connectors, Popular connectors used in Microsoft Power Apps, Standard and Custom connectors, Connecting to Microsoft Dataverse and finally we had a codelab that taught us how to Connect or Build an app with data gotten from Google Sheet, which is an example of a Standard Connector. \n\nThank You"

          "content": "In this article we will be following up from our previous article **Using Data Connectors with Microsoft Power Apps** to learn about the Timer Control input component used in Microsoft Power Apps. \n\n<!-- truncate -->\n\n## What is Timer Control in PowerApps?\nTimer Control in PowerApps, is simply an Input Component amongst the Insert tools used for building apps. \n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.20.40.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650752465275/HaJJ1AO--.png)\n\nIt's also a control that can determine how your app responds after a certain amount of time.\n\nTimers can, for example, determine how long a control appears or change other properties of a control after a certain amount of time has passed.\n\n\n### Key Properties for using the Timer Control Component in Power Apps\n\n**Duration** – This is how long a timer runs in milliseconds. The maximum is 24 hours expressed in milliseconds. Default is 60 seconds.\n\n**OnTimerEnd** – This is an actions to perform when a timer finishes running.\n\n**Repeat** – The repeat function determines if a timer automatically restarts when it finishes couting, making use of the set time.\n\n**AutoPause** – This function determines if the timer control automatically pauses, after a user navigates to a different screen.\n\n**AutoStart** – The AutoStart function determines if the timer control automatically starts to play when the user navigates to the screen that contains that control.\n\n**OnSelect** – OnSelect is used to set actions to perform when the user taps or clicks the Timer component.\n\n**OnTimerStart** – OnTimerStart helps a user to set actions to perform when a timer starts to run.\n\n\n# Implementing Timer Control Component \nFollowing up from a previous article, where we built an application using Power Apps, kindly go back to the article before you proceed; [Using Data Connectors with Microsoft Power Apps](https://thecompletehub.tech/understanding-data-connectors-with-microsoft-power-apps). Also, you can check out this video, to understand better, before we proceed:\n\n%[https://www.youtube.com/shorts/sitW9uOeTvg]\n\nNow let us implement our Timer Control Component in our previously built Power App: \n\nGo to Screen 3 **(Our Success Screen)**\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.36.24.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650753412047/8xDuLRr3X.png)\n\nClick on the Insert Tool Item and Search for \"Timer\"\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.38.06.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650753546954/uo87lDPs4.png)\n\nAdd the Timer to Screen3 Components\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.40.03.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650753637767/XaTil-hWw.png)\n\n**Now, we need to set a few parameters for the Timer Component:**\n\nFirstly, is the duration. \n\nYou can specify in milliseconds here. Example: 3000 i.e. 3 seconds\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.42.13.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650753746393/MRzZPk_pB.png)\n\nNext, you’ll need to set the Start flag. By default, this is set to false. The Start is triggered when the value is set to True. This needs to be dynamically set from elsewhere i.e. in this example, you’ll need to trigger from where you come to this screen so that the Timer starts the countdown.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.44.00.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650753870590/sEt69kDsO.png)\n\nNow, the way I set this is, first I create a variable from the place where I want to trigger the Timer to go off, that is my previous Screen (Screen2).  I’m creating and setting a variable called startTimer and setting the value to true:\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-24 at 00.09.54.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650755420667/M5h7eltB1.png)\n\nYou will then return to your Timer Component in Screen3 and set this variable startTimer to the Start property.\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-23 at 23.53.36.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650754432720/q1AghZ4ve.png)\n\nAlso, you’ll need to set what needs to happen when the Timer ends. So, you have to write the OnTimerEnd property as to what will happen once the Timer ends.\nHere, you’ll Navigate to the 'Screen4’ as per our scenario and then also, set the startTimer flag to ‘false’ since you want to reuse this again for the next submission.\n\nNow this works fine as Screen 4 loads immediately after the duration of the timer is elapsed.\n\nFinally, I will hide the timer component from showing on the screen. \nTo do this I will set the visible property to false. It is set to true by default, and by doing this immediately our timer becomes not visible but still works properly. \n\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-24 at 00.14.39.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650755803020/zV9xntL2b.png)\n\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-24 at 00.14.52.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650755832207/AivDtFZg9.png)\n\nIn conclusion, with this new feature added to our app, we can now remove the previous buttons added to navigate to Screen4 from the Success Screen (Screen3), and this is the new look for Screen 3\n\n![Screenshot 2022-04-24 at 00.19.24.png](https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1650755992913/aB_UqMDol.png)\n\nNow we have improved our app by using the Timer control component to our app. \n\n\nAs said earlier to fully understand everything discussed up till this point, kindly read and understand the previous article on **Using Data Connectors with Microsoft Power Apps** \n\nFinally, I will be ending this article, with helpful resources to aid you learning\n\n## Learning Resources\n\n1.

          "content": "Node.js is a javascript framework that allows us to run javascript outside the browser, it is a javascript runtime built on chrome v8 engine.\r\n\r\nSkipping the not-so-boring stuff we will be trying our hands at building a simple web server using a popular javascript framework called 'Express'. \r\n\r\n<!-- truncate -->\r\n\r\nExpress is a framework that gives node.js superpowers because of its amazing feature. Express is built on top of Node's features to provide easy to use functionality, it runs between the server created by Node.js and the frontend pages of our application.\r\n\r\n**Let us dive in 👨‍💻!**\r\n\r\nSo what is a web server? A web server in simple terms hosts our web pages and web content. To access these contents clients (i.e browsers) make an HTTP request to the server for these contents.\r\n\r\n# Developer Environment setup\r\n\r\nTo follow through with this tutorial you would have to install Node and you can do this by going to the official [Node site](https://nodejs.org/en/). If Node is already installed you can check your node version by opening your command prompt and typing `node -v` . If Node.js is installed the version installed will be displayed.\r\n\r\nSince Node.js is installed, we need to create a directory for the project using the `command mk-dir project-name` (project-name is the name of your directory) you can navigate to the directory with the command `cd project-name`. To start our project and create a package.json file, we run the command `npm init`. A package.json file contains basic information about your project such as the name, author, version, description and dependencies ...we won't be diving into all of that in this article.\r\n\r\n...for starters\r\n\r\n> **npm [Node Package Manager](https://npmjs.com)** is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language maintained by npm, Inc. npm is the default package manager for the JavaScript runtime environment Node.js. It consists of an online database of public and paid-for private packages, called the npm registry. It is a command-line tool used to share Node.js packages/modules.\r\n\r\nTo install a package in this project, navigate to your desired directory and run `npm install package-name` on the terminal. to install a package globally, run `npm install package-name --global` (shortcut -g instead of --global). We need to install Express in this project's directory, we'll run the command `npm install express --save`. also for --save (shortcut -s) now our package is added to the list of dependencies in the package.json file.\r\n\r\nNow we are done with the setup, we can now go to building our server.\r\n\r\n# Code along\r\n\r\nNavigate to your code editor and create an index.js file in the directory created earlier.\r\n\r\nNow, we have to import the installed express module.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nconst express = require(\"express\");\r\n\r\n// Now we have to create an instance of express\r\nconst app = express();\r\n\r\n// we tell `app` to listen for GET requests to our server based on the specified path ('/') and send a specific response, using the get() method:\r\napp.get(\"/\", (req, res) => res.send(\"My Node.js Web Server 🐱‍🏍!\"));\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n// we start our web server by telling the app to listen on a specific port (8000 in this case) and run our callback function when the server starts up:\r\napp.listen(8000,  () =>\r\nconsole.log(\"Listening to port 8000 successful!\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Starting the Server\r\n\r\nInorder to run the code that we have just written and start up the server, we simply run `node index.js` in our terminal, shortcut to open terminal in vs Code`ctrl + Shift + ` ` , then open localhost:8000 in your browser. You should see the response displayed.\r\n\r\n# Conclusion:\r\n\r\nHope you had fun building this simple web server with express. I hope you keep on learning and building more amazing projects. There will be more articles surrounding web development topics."

          "content": "This article is targeted at young innovative minds, who are passionate about building amazing products with Low-Code tools. \n\nIt will be a detailed break down of Microsoft Power Platform for someone who is just hearing about this for the first time, or someone who needs clarity around what Microsoft Power Platform is about. \n<!-- truncate -->\n\nLets talk!\n\nMicrosoft's Power Platform is a No-Code/Low-Code Platform for Building amazing solutions faster with very little or no code. Hence the reason it is classified as a **Low-Code** product.\n\nPower Platform comprises of five key products, which are: **Power Apps, Power Automate, Power BI, Power Virtual Agents, and recently Power Pages (recently called Portals)**\n\nMicrosoft Power Platform products/tools allows you to automate processes, build mobile and web app solutions faster, analyze data, and create virtual chat agents, powered by Artificial Intelligience. \n\nNow let us learn more about these products: \n\n## Power Apps\n\n![powerapps.jpeg](./Power%20AutomateD.png)\n\nPower Apps provides a rapid low code development environment for building custom apps for business needs. \n\nMicrosoft Power Apps is not used for building ordinary custom applications, but apps built using Power Apps provide rich business logic and workflow capabilities to transform your manual business operations into digital, automated processes.\n\nIt has services, connectors, scalable data services and app platform (Microsoft Dataverse) to allow simple integration and interaction with existing data, giving you the ability to connect with data from different sources using [Standard and Custom Connectors](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/canvas-apps/connections-list). \n\nWith Power Apps, you build **Canvas apps or  Model-Driven apps**, by connecting your business data that is stored either in the underlying data platform (Microsoft Dataverse) or in various online and on-premises data sources (SharePoint, Excel, Office 365, Dynamics 365, SQL Server, Google Sheets and so on).\n\n*Microsoft Dataverse lets you securely store and manage data that is used by business applications. Data within Dataverse is stored within a set of tables.*\n\nFind out more in this documentation: [What is Microsoft Dataverse?](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-apps/maker/data-platform/data-platform-intro)\n\n\n### Canvas Apps\nA Canvas app just like the name implies is an app built by dragging and dropping elements onto a canvas, just as you would design a slide in PowerPoint.\n\nCanvas apps give you the flexibility to arrange the user experience and interface the way you want it. Allow your creativity and business sense to guide how you want your apps to look and feel.\n\nWith Canvas apps you build apps that integrate business data from a wide variety of Microsoft and third-party sources. \n\nCheck out this Codelab [Create a canvas app from a sample template in Power Apps](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/canvas-apps/open-and-run-a-sample-app), to find out more and build your first Canvas App. \n\n### Model-Driven Apps\n\nModel-Driven Apps or Process Driven Apps design is an approach that focuses on adding components such as forms, views, and charts and dashboards to tables using an app designer tool. \n\nModel-driven apps starts with your data model – building up from the shape of your core business data and processes in the Dataverse to model forms, views, and other components.\n\nModel-driven apps are highly responsive across several devices.\n\nAdditionally, relationships connect tables together in a way that permits navigation between them and ensures that data is not repeated unnecessarily.\n\nWhile they're called model-driven apps, it is often easier to think of them as data model-driven apps. \n\nThis is because, without a data model housed within [Microsoft Dataverse](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/model-driven-app-glossary#dataverse), you can't create a model-driven app.\n\nUsing the app designer with little or no code, you can build apps that are simple or very complex, connecting with a Microsoft Dataverse.\n\nCheck out this Codelab [Build your first model-driven app](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powerapps/maker/model-driven-apps/build-first-model-driven-app)\n\n\n## Power Automate\n![Power Automate](./Power%20AutomateD%20(1).png)\n\nPower Automate is an online workflow service that automates actions across the most common apps and services.\n\nAn automated process/task simply means streamlining a system by removing human inputs, which decreases errors, increases speed of delivery, boosts quality, minimizes costs, and simplifies the business process. \n\nYou can use Power Automate to automate workflows between your favorite applications and services, sync files, get notifications, collect data, and much more.\n\nA very good use of Power Automate will be to automate the task of sending a requisition to the Team lead or Head of your department in your office/organisation, which is to be carried out every Monday morning. \n\nWith Power Automate, you simply create a flow to perform that task for you every morning, hence ensuring that task is performed always smoothly. \n\nAnother good example will be to monitor what people are saying about your business by creating a flow that runs whenever someone sends a tweet with a certain hashtag. The flow can add details about each tweet to a Facebook post, a SQL Server database, a Microsoft Lists list, or even a Microsoft Excel file that's hosted on OneDrive for Business–-whichever service works for you.\n\n*A flow communicates between your business applications so they can work with each other to eliminate the need for manual processes. A flow begins with a 'trigger', a pre-defined event that then triggers a response.*\n\nTo understand more about Power Automate and Power Automate flows, check out: [Overview of the different types of flows](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-automate/flow-types).\n\n## Power BI\n![Power BI](./Power%20BI.png)\n\nMicrosoft Power Business Intelligience (BI) is one of the most popular of the five Microsoft Power Platform Products. \n\nPower BI is a very great tool used for data analysis, collaboration and presentation. \n\nPower BI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, or a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses. \n\nPower BI lets you easily connect to your data sources, visualize and discover what's important, and share that with anyone or everyone you want.\n\nThe three (3) basic **Power BI** elements are: \n1. Power BI Desktop\n2. Power BI Service\n3. Power BI mobile apps. \n\nThese three basic elements all work together with certain functionalities reserved for each of the elements. \n\nPower BI Desktop is a **Windows desktop application**. Power BI Service is an **online *Software as a Service*. Power BI mobile apps are basically apps for iOS and Android devices. \n\nMore recently Power BI have evolved from just being a tool for viewing reports and dashboards, to a tool used to push data into datasets or embed dashboards and reports into your own custom applications. \n\nOne common workflow in Power BI begins by connecting to data sources in Power BI Desktop and building a report. You then publish that report from Power BI Desktop to the Power BI service, and share it so business users in the Power BI service and on mobile devices can view and interact with the report.\n\nTo find out more on Power BI, check out [Power BI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/). \n\n## Power Virtual Chat Agents\n\n![Power Virtual Agents](./Power%20virtual%20agents.png)\n\nPower Virtual Agents is another amazing Power Platform Product which is used for building AI Powered ChatBots which can be used in custom websites, Applications, and some social media platforms (Facebook, Microsoft Teams, etc). \n\nPower Virtual Agents are adaptable Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots, at your service.\n\nThey can solve common customer and internal-facing issues automatically, freeing up staff to focus on complex requests and high-value interactions. \n\nYou can easily create your own virtual agents, powerful chatbots, without the need for developers or data scientists, by using a guided, no-code graphical interface.\n\n### Important Concepts on Power Virtual Agents ###\n\nWhen you create chatbots with Power Virtual Agents, you author and edit topics. \n\nTopics: Topics are discrete conversation paths that, when used together within a single chatbot, allow for users to have a conversation with a chatbot that feels natural and flows appropriately. \n\nIn Power Virtual Agents, a topic defines how a chatbot conversation plays out. You can author topics by customizing provided templates, create new topics from scratch, or get suggestions from existing help sites.\n\nTrigger phrases: These are phrases, keywords, or questions that a user is likely to type that is related to a specific issue—and conversation nodes—these are what you use to define how a chatbot should respond and what it should do.\n\nThe AI uses natural language understanding to parse what a customer actually types and find the most appropriate trigger phrase or node.\n\nFor example, a user might type \"Open hours\" into your chatbot, the AI will be able to match that to the Store hours topic and begin a conversation that asks which store the customer is interested in, and then display the hours the store is open.\n\nEntities: An entity can be viewed as an information unit that represents a certain type of a real-world subject, like a phone number, zip code, city, or even a person's name.\n\nActions: An Action in Power Virtual Agents simply refers to the integration of a Microsoft Power Automate flow into a Chatbot to perform an action. \n\nRemember I stated it earlier that Microsoft Power Apps enables the creation of web and mobile applications that run on all devices, in this section of the article we will be looking at running a power app on a mobile device. \n\nTo learn more about [Power Virtual Agents](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-power-virtual-agents/). \n\n## Power Pages\n![Power Pages](./Power%20pages.png)\n\nPower Pages, the latest member of the Power Platform family, was announced during Microsoft Build 2022. \n\nMicrosoft Power Pages formerly known as Portals, is a new standalone product. \n\nAs a new standalone Product, Power Pages is a secure, enterprise-grade, low-code software as a service (SaaS) platform, that empowers you to create, host, and administer modern external-facing business websites quickly and easily, that seamlessly work across web browsers and devices.\n\nExtending beyond portals capabilities, Power Pages empowers anyone, regardless of their technical background, with an effective platform to create data-powered, modern, and secure websites.\n\nWith new and exciting features added to this new product, businesses can now have a modern and secure website, which is built on a low-code platform that is business-centric in nature.\n\n### Features and capabilities available in Power Pages\n\n1. The Design Studio: The Design Studio makes it easy to design, style, configure and publish modern business websites. Start from scratch or use one of the ready-to-use templates to design your site pages with text, video, images, business data forms and lists, and more.\n\n2.
